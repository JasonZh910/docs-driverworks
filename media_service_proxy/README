Control4’s Media Service Proxy (MSP) provides a layer of commands, notifications, events and other data handling elements that will support the development of drivers for media-based services and devices. This iteration of a media-focused proxy represents a new direction in driver development as it uses Control4’s .c4z driver architecture and offers the ability to support XML-based user interfaces.

From an end user perspective, drivers written against the Media Service Proxy will be able to provide a user interface that can browse cloud based media services consistently across numerous navigator devices. The proxy is designed to be platform independent with regard to devices displaying its user interface while maintaining the ability to easily integrate with new clouds or devices introduced to the Control4 system.

Currently, driver deveopment resources include:

MSP By Numbers: An iterative, sample based tutorial on creating a driver using the Media Service Proxy.

MSP Driver Suite: Example drivers written based on the Media Service Proxy.

MSP Driver Deveopment Documentation: The latest implemetaion guide for the MSP.
