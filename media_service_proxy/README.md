Snap One’s Media Service Proxy (MSP) provides a layer of commands, notifications, events and other data handling elements which support the development of drivers for media-based services and devices. This iteration of a media-focused proxy represents a new direction in driver development as it uses Snap One’s .c4z driver architecture and offers the ability to support XML-based user interfaces.

From an end user perspective, drivers written against the Media Service Proxy will be able to provide a user interface that can browse cloud based media services consistently across numerous navigator devices. The proxy is designed to be platform independent with regard to devices displaying its user interface while maintaining the ability to easily integrate with new clouds or devices introduced to the Snap One system.

Currently, driver deveopment resources include:

MSP By Numbers: An iterative, sample based tutorial on creating a driver using the Media Service Proxy.

MSP Driver Suite: Example drivers written based on the Media Service Proxy.

MSP Driver Deveopment Documentation: The latest implemetaion guide for the MSP.

Note that several resource detailed in teh MSP Driver Deveopment Documentation are outdayed or no longer supported. These include: 

Hello World Sample Driver - This driver is outdated and no longer exists. While not complete, the MSP by Numbers sample is the best simple reference currently available.

HW Selected Device and HW Streaming Device drivers - These drivers are out dated and no longer exist. The My Music DLNA driver is a complete and fully functional driver that you can reference.

The MSP Schema doc and Schema validator are out of date and no longer in the repo.
